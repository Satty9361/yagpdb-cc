## Adding these Custom Commands
This assumes you know how to create a custom command. This repository is separated into groups / categories. Most categories have standalone custom commands, meaning you can add one, two, or even all of them without issues.
There are some "systems" which require you to add *all* commands. This is detailed in the individual `README.md` of that section.

When you find a custom command you wish to add, the file will have a leading comment explaining what it does and the recommended trigger type & trigger. You can add it in the YAGPDB dashboard with these attributes.
